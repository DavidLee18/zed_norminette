# zed_norminette
a zed extension to enable in-editor norminette linting

this extension downloads and executes the LSP for 42 Norminette. This means when you open or save a file, norminette errors will be present in Zed. And if combined with [inject_42h](https://github.com/DavidLee18/inject_42h), it automatically creates or updates the 42 header for you, when you save a file.

details are in the [inject_42h repo](https://github.com/DavidLee18/inject_42h).
